Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/ruslan/Desktop/webDevLearn/shorty-new/src/components/Form.jsx

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder shorty-new
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder shorty-new by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
[Info  - 3:19:47 PM] ESLint server stopped.
